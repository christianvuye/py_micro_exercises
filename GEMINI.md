# Gemini Project Context: Python Practice Microprojects

This file provides context for the Gemini AI assistant to effectively assist with this project.

## Project Overview

This repository is a collection of Python micro-projects designed for practice and learning. It covers fundamental and advanced concepts in Python, including Object-Oriented Programming, data normalization techniques, and functional programming paradigms.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python

## Coding Conventions

- Follow the existing coding style and patterns within the file being edited.
- Adhere to PEP 8 standards for new Python code.

## Build and Test Commands

- Tests appear to be located in the `data_normalization` directory.
- To run tests, the following command is likely used:
  ```bash
  python -m pytest data_normalization/
  ```

## Directory Structure

- `class_fundamentals/`: Contains examples of Python classes, demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming concepts.
- `data_normalization/`: Includes scripts for cleaning and standardizing data, along with corresponding tests.
- `fp_concepts/`: Provides small, focused examples of functional programming concepts like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and `lambda` functions.
- `fp_in_de/`: Shows the application of functional programming concepts in the context of data engineering.
