Remove Duplicates - Spaced Repetition

Write a function, remove_duplicates, that takes in a list as an argument.
The function should return a new list with duplicate elements removed.
The order of elements should be preserved based on their first occurrence.

Example:
remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4]) â†’ [1, 2, 3, 4]
remove_duplicates([5, 5, 5, 5]) â†’ [5]
remove_duplicates([]) â†’ []
remove_duplicates([1]) â†’ [1]
remove_duplicates(['a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'b']) â†’ ['a', 'b', 'c']

Write your own test cases and implement the solution.
After completing, analyze time and space complexity.

=== EXERCISE #10 SUMMARY - REMOVE DUPLICATES (SPACED REPETITION) ===

Pattern Mastery: ðŸŸ¢ OPTIMAL ALGORITHM SELECTION
- Perfect combination of set (tracking) + list (order preservation)
- Correct understanding that sets alone cannot solve order-preserving deduplication
- Clean single-pass implementation with proper edge case handling
- Strong grasp of data structure trade-offs for specific requirements

Interview Readiness: ðŸŸ¢ EXCELLENT ENGINEERING PRACTICES
- Empirical testing of alternative approaches (list(set(lst)))
- Accurate complexity analysis with minor clarification needed
- Professional input constraint questions about mixed types and hashability
- Understanding of Python equality edge cases (1/True, 0/False, 1/1.0)

Spaced Repetition Performance: ðŸ“ˆ STRONG ANALYTICAL VERIFICATION
- Applied familiar set-based pattern to new order-preservation requirement
- Self-directed testing of theoretical assumptions vs practical results
- Demonstrated that empirical evidence beats theoretical reasoning
- Quick recognition of optimal approach for constraint satisfaction

Next Review Schedule:
- Tomorrow (Aug 30): 1st review
- Sept 1: 2nd review (+2 days)
- Sept 4: 3rd review (+3 days)
- Sept 8: 4th review (+4 days)
- Interview Sept 10: Should be automatic by then

Time Complexity: O(n) - always scan entire input regardless of duplicates
Space Complexity: O(k) where k = unique elements, worst case O(n)
Pattern Type: Set-based tracking with order-preserving list construction
Core Skills: Data structure combination, order preservation, empirical validation

Key Strengths Demonstrated:
- Optimal algorithm selection for order-preserving deduplication
- Empirical testing of alternative solutions (engineering rigor)
- Accurate complexity analysis understanding with search results validation
- Professional handling of mixed type constraints and equality edge cases
- Strong pattern adaptation from basic set operations to order-preservation

Areas for Minor Refinement:
- Type hint syntax (list[Any] vs list[any], or simpler list for interviews)
- Time complexity precision (always O(n), not conditional on duplicate distribution)

Status: ðŸ”„ NEEDS SPACED REPETITION - Follow review schedule to achieve mastery
Note: Shows excellent engineering verification practices and optimal solution design
