Longest Word - Spaced Repetition

Write a function, longest_word, that takes in a sentence string as an argument.
The function should return the longest word in the sentence. If there is a tie,
return the word that occurs later in the sentence.

You can assume that the sentence is non-empty.

Example:
longest_word("when in rome do as the romans do") â†’ "romans"
longest_word("I love dogs") â†’ "dogs"

Write your own test cases and implement the solution.
After completing, analyze time and space complexity.

        str: The longest word found in the sentence.

=== EXERCISE #2 SUMMARY - LONGEST WORD (SPACED REPETITION) ===

Pattern Mastery: ðŸŸ¢ STRONG PROGRESS
- String manipulation and iteration pattern well understood
- Correct tie-breaking logic implementation (>= operator)
- Clean single-pass approach with proper edge case handling

Interview Readiness: ðŸŸ¢ VERY PROMISING
- Excellent critical thinking - correctly rejected instructor's flawed "optimization"
- Robust testing methodology with comprehensive edge cases
- Strong complexity analysis with proper variable definitions
- Good attention to requirements (caught instructor error in example)

Spaced Repetition Performance: ðŸ“ˆ EXCELLENT FIRST ATTEMPT
- Comprehensive test coverage including punctuation scenarios
- Proper documentation of assumptions about word boundaries
- Advanced algorithmic thinking about alternative approaches
- Critical evaluation of trade-offs and complexity

Next Review Schedule:
- Tomorrow (Aug 30): 1st review
- Sept 1: 2nd review (+2 days)
- Sept 4: 3rd review (+3 days)
- Sept 8: 4th review (+4 days)
- Interview Sept 10: Should be automatic by then

Time Complexity: O(w Ã— m) where w=words, m=avg word length
Space Complexity: O(w Ã— m) due to split operation creating word list
Pattern Type: Linear scan with conditional updates and tie-breaking
Core Skills: String processing, tie-breaking logic, critical algorithm analysis

Key Strengths Demonstrated:
- Caught instructor error in problem example (attention to detail)
- Correctly rejected "optimization" that was actually worse (O(w Ã— mÂ²))
- Comprehensive test coverage with edge cases
- Strong complexity analysis and variable definition clarity
- Excellent critical thinking about algorithmic trade-offs

Status: ðŸ”„ NEEDS SPACED REPETITION - Follow review schedule to achieve mastery
Note: Shows advanced analytical skills beyond typical first attempts
