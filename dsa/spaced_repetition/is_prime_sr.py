Is Prime - Spaced Repetition

Write a function, is_prime, that takes in a number as an argument. The function
should return a boolean indicating whether or not the given number is prime.

A prime number is a number that is only divisible by two distinct numbers: 1 and itself.

For example, 7 is a prime because it is only divisible by 1 and 7.
For example, 6 is not a prime because it is divisible by 1, 2, 3, and 6.

You can assume that the input number is a positive integer.

Example:
is_prime(2) â†’ True
is_prime(3) â†’ True
is_prime(4) â†’ False
is_prime(5) â†’ True
is_prime(6) â†’ False
is_prime(7) â†’ True

Write your own test cases and implement the solution.
After completing, analyze time and space complexity.

=== EXERCISE #7 SUMMARY - IS PRIME (SPACED REPETITION) ===

Pattern Mastery: ðŸŸ¢ STRONG MATHEMATICAL REASONING
- Correctly identified and implemented square root optimization independently
- Sound algorithmic logic with proper edge case handling (0, 1, 2)
- Clean iterative approach with early termination on factor discovery
- Demonstrates understanding of mathematical efficiency principles

Interview Readiness: ðŸŸ¢ OPTIMIZATION-FOCUSED APPROACH
- Recognized key performance improvement opportunity (O(n) â†’ O(âˆšn))
- Should have asked about library imports upfront (good learning point)
- Comprehensive test coverage including edge cases and larger test values
- Clear complexity analysis with minor correction needed on space complexity

Spaced Repetition Performance: ðŸ“ˆ STRONG PROBLEM-SOLVING
