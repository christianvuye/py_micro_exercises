First Repeated - Spaced Repetition

Write a function, first_repeated, that takes in a string as an argument.
The function should return the first character that appears more than once
in the string. If no character repeats, return None.

Example:
first_repeated("abccba") â†’ "c"
first_repeated("abcdef") â†’ None
first_repeated("hello") â†’ "l"
first_repeated("") â†’ None

Write your own test cases and implement the solution.
After completing, analyze time and space complexity.

=== EXERCISE #9 SUMMARY - FIRST REPEATED (SPACED REPETITION) ===

Pattern Mastery: ðŸŸ¢ EXCELLENT PATTERN TRANSFER
- Applied "have I seen this before?" pattern from has_duplicates/all_unique
- Set-based tracking with early termination optimization perfectly executed
- Clean single-pass algorithm with optimal early return logic
- Strong understanding of pattern family variations (existence vs identification)

Interview Readiness: ðŸŸ¢ PROFESSIONAL APPROACH
- Excellent clarifying questions about case sensitivity and input types
- Caught instructor error on Python best practice (`is None` vs `== None`)
- Understanding of HackerRank interview format vs practice testing approaches
- Clean implementation with proper type hints and documentation

Spaced Repetition Performance: ðŸ“ˆ ACCELERATING PATTERN RECOGNITION
- Immediate recognition of similarity to previous set-based exercises
- Faster implementation time showing pattern internalization
- Self-correction on Python idioms showing attention to code quality
- Efficient edge case handling without prompting

Next Review Schedule:
- Tomorrow (Aug 30): 1st review
- Sept 1: 2nd review (+2 days)
- Sept 4: 3rd review (+3 days)
- Sept 8: 4th review (+4 days)
- Interview Sept 10: Should be automatic by then

Time Complexity: O(1) best case, O(n) worst case
Space Complexity: O(1) best case, O(n) worst case
Pattern Type: Set-based character tracking with early termination
Core Skills: Hash table optimization, early return patterns, string processing

Key Strengths Demonstrated:
- Immediate pattern recognition from previous similar exercises
- Professional clarifying questions about requirements and constraints
- Python best practice knowledge (`is None` over `== None`)
- Understanding of real interview platform constraints vs practice testing
- Accurate complexity analysis with clear best/worst case identification
- Clean code with proper type hints and documentation

Areas of Excellence:
- Pattern transfer ability across similar but distinct problems
- Code quality attention to Python idioms and best practices
- Professional interview question behavior matching real scenarios

Status: ðŸ”„ NEEDS SPACED REPETITION - Follow review schedule to achieve mastery
Note: Shows strong progression in both pattern recognition and interview readiness
