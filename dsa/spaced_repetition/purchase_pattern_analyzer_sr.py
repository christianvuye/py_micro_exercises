Purchase Pattern Analyzer - Multi-Category Analysis

You need to analyze e-commerce purchase data to find users who bought items from multiple categories.
This helps identify diverse customers for targeted marketing.

You'll get a list of purchase records, where each record contains a user ID and a product category.
Find all users who purchased from more than one category.

The purchase data could be quite large - handle millions of transactions efficiently.

=== EXERCISE #28 SUMMARY - PURCHASE PATTERN ANALYZER (SPACED REPETITION) ===

Pattern Mastery: ðŸŸ¢ CLEAN EXECUTION
- Dictionary + set aggregation pattern implemented correctly
- Proper grouping logic: user_id as key, categories as set values
- Correct filtering: len(categories) > 1 for multi-category users

Interview Readiness: ðŸŸ¢ ADVANCED COMPLEXITY REASONING
- Sophisticated space complexity analysis considering data distribution
- Understanding of typical vs worst-case scenarios in real e-commerce data
- Professional requirements clarification about data quality and edge cases
- Recognition of O(n) as optimal for group-and-count problems

Spaced Repetition Performance: ðŸ“ˆ STRONG TECHNICAL PRECISION
- No syntax struggles with dictionary initialization or set operations
- Clean manual dictionary approach showing fundamental understanding
- Efficient use of sets for automatic deduplication per user

Next Review Schedule:
- Sept 2: 1st review (+2 days)
- Sept 5: 2nd review (+3 days)
- Sept 9: 3rd review (+4 days)
- Interview Sept 10: Pattern should be automatic

Time Complexity: O(n) - must process every record, optimal for grouping problems
Space Complexity: O(u Ã— avg_categories) typically, O(n) worst case
Pattern Type: Group-by aggregation with set deduplication per group
Core Skills: Dictionary grouping, set operations, data distribution analysis

Key Strengths Demonstrated:
- Advanced understanding of how data characteristics affect space complexity
- Clean implementation of grouping pattern without helper libraries
- Professional edge case consideration and data quality assumptions
- Sophisticated reasoning about typical vs worst-case algorithmic behavior

Status: ðŸ”„ NEEDS SPACED REPETITION - Follow review schedule
Note: Shows advanced grasp of real-world algorithmic performance considerations
