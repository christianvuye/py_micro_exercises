Contains Target - Two Sum Existence Check

Write a function `contains_target` that takes in a list of numbers and a target sum as arguments.
The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not there exist two distinct elements
in the list that sum to the target value.

=== EXERCISE #20 SUMMARY - CONTAINS TARGET (SPACED REPETITION) ===

Pattern Mastery: ðŸŸ¢ EXCELLENT IMPLEMENTATION
- Optimal complement lookup approach using set
- Perfect "check before add" logic for distinct element requirement
- Early return optimization for efficient performance
- Clean, readable implementation with proper type hints
- Demonstrates mastery of fundamental two-sum pattern

Interview Readiness: ðŸŸ¢ PROFESSIONAL QUALITY SOLUTION
- Caught test case error: 4 + 1 = 5 (shows attention to detail)
- Professional clarifying questions about data types and distinct elements
- Optimal O(n) time complexity with hash set approach
- Clean code structure with comprehensive documentation

Spaced Repetition Performance: ðŸ“ˆ STRONG COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS
- Accurate time complexity: O(n) worst case, better with early termination
- Correct space complexity: O(n) worst case for unique elements
- Shows understanding of best/worst case scenarios
- Solid improvement in complexity reasoning precision

Next Review Schedule:
- Sept 1: 1st review (tomorrow)
- Sept 3: 2nd review (+2 days)
- Sept 6: 3rd review (+3 days)
- Sept 9: 4th review (+3 days) [Final prep before interview]

Time Complexity: O(n) worst case, O(1) best case
Space Complexity: O(n) worst case for unique elements  
Pattern Type: Two Sum existence check with complement lookup
Core Skills: Hash set usage, complement calculation, early termination

Key Strengths Demonstrated:
- Optimal algorithmic approach selection (complement lookup vs brute force)
- Professional attention to detail (caught test case error)
- Accurate complexity analysis with best/worst case understanding
- Clean implementation with proper type hints and documentation
- Strong pattern recognition for two-sum problems

ðŸŽ‰ TIER 2 COMPLETE: Pattern Recognition (Exercises 11-20) FINISHED

Status: ðŸ”„ NEEDS SPACED REPETITION - Follow review schedule to achieve mastery
Note: Ready to advance to Tier 3: Advanced Patterns (Exercises 21-30)
