Word Frequency Counter - Advanced Word Counting Techniques

Build a word frequency analyzer for text processing. Given a string of text,
count how many times each word appears and return the words that appear more than once.

Requirements:
- Words are separated by spaces
- Ignore case (so 'The' and 'the' are the same word)
- Remove punctuation from words
- Return list of words that appear more than once
- Optimize for processing large text documents

The input text could be quite large - think about efficiency.

    Returns a list of words that appear more than once in the given text.

    The function processes the input text by:
    - Converting all characters to lowercase.
    - Splitting the text into words.
    - Removing non-alphabetic characters from each word.
    - Counting the frequency of each cleaned word.
    - Returning a list of words that occur more than once.

    Args:
        text (str): The input text to analyze.

    Returns:
        list[str]: A list of words (in lowercase, alphabetic only) that appear more than once.

=== EXERCISE #29 SUMMARY - WORD FREQUENCY COUNTER (SPACED REPETITION) ===

Pattern Mastery: ðŸŸ¢ CLEAN TEXT PROCESSING EXECUTION
- Manual character filtering with .isalpha() approach
- Proper edge case handling for empty words after punctuation removal
- Clean frequency counting with manual dictionary management

Interview Readiness: ðŸŸ¢ EXCEPTIONAL COMPLEXITY REASONING
- Precise O(n Ã— m) complexity analysis correctly identifying nested loop structure
- Corrected instructor's oversimplified O(n) analysis with sophisticated reasoning
- Advanced understanding of string processing costs and character-level operations
- Professional edge case consideration (empty strings, punctuation-only words)

Spaced Repetition Performance: ðŸ“ˆ STRONG PROBLEM-SOLVING APPROACH
- Creative solution using .isalpha() instead of regex or library functions
- Quick debugging and fix for empty word edge case
- Superior algorithmic analysis demonstrating deep understanding of nested processing

Next Review Schedule:
- Sept 2: 1st review (+2 days)
- Sept 5: 2nd review (+3 days)
- Sept 9: 3rd review (+4 days)
- Interview Sept 10: Pattern should be automatic

Time Complexity: O(n Ã— m) where n=words, m=avg chars per word (equivalent to O(N) total chars)
Space Complexity: O(N) - multiple string copies and dictionary storage
Pattern Type: Text preprocessing + frequency analysis with manual character filtering
Core Skills: String processing, character validation, nested loop analysis

Key Strengths Demonstrated:
- **Superior complexity analysis**: Correctly identified O(n Ã— m) nested structure
- **Critical thinking**: Questioned and corrected instructor's complexity simplification
- **Precise algorithmic reasoning**: Distinguished between loop structure and total work
- **Advanced understanding**: Recognized equivalence between O(n Ã— m) and O(N) notations

Status: ðŸ”„ NEEDS SPACED REPETITION - Follow review schedule
Note: Shows exceptional algorithmic analysis skills - corrected instructor's oversimplification
