Fizz Buzz - Spaced Repetition

Write a function, fizz_buzz, that takes in a number n as an argument. The function
should return a list containing numbers from 1 to n, replacing certain numbers
according to the following rules:

* if the number is divisible by 3, make the element "fizz"
* if the number is divisible by 5, make the element "buzz"
* if the number is divisible by 3 and 5, make the element "fizzbuzz"

Example:
fizz_buzz(5) â†’ [1, 2, "fizz", 4, "buzz"]
fizz_buzz(15) â†’ [1, 2, "fizz", 4, "buzz", "fizz", 7, 8, "fizz", "buzz", 11, "fizz", 13, 14, "fizzbuzz"]

Write your own test cases and implement the solution.
After completing, analyze time and space complexity.

=== EXERCISE #8 SUMMARY - FIZZ BUZZ (SPACED REPETITION) ===

Pattern Mastery: ğŸŸ¢ SOLID CONDITIONAL LOGIC
- Correct conditional precedence (fizzbuzz before fizz/buzz)
- Clean list building with mixed data types (int | str)
- Proper edge case handling for n < 1 scenarios
- Sound iterative approach with appropriate range usage

Interview Readiness: ğŸŸ¢ COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH
- Professional input validation questions about constraints
- Excellent progressive test coverage (1â†’2â†’3â†’4â†’5â†’15)
- Accurate complexity analysis with realistic optimization assessment  
- Minor type hint correction needed (list[int, str] â†’ list[int | str])

Spaced Repetition Performance: ğŸ“ˆ BUILDING PATTERN DIVERSITY
- Fourth different algorithmic pattern (after hash tables, math, conditional logic)
- Strong edge case intuition across multiple problem types
- Correct skepticism about optimization possibilities (O(n) is inherent)
- Good analysis of alternative implementation trade-offs

Next Review Schedule:
- Tomorrow (Aug 30): 1st review
- Sept 1: 2nd review (+2 days)
- Sept 4: 3rd review (+3 days)  
- Sept 8: 4th review (+4 days)
- Interview Sept 10: Should be automatic by then

Time Complexity: O(n) - must process every position from 1 to n
Space Complexity: O(n) - output list grows linearly with input
Pattern Type: Iterative list construction with conditional logic
Core Skills: Modulo operations, conditional precedence, mixed-type lists

Key Strengths Demonstrated:
- Proper conditional ordering to handle overlapping cases (divisible by both)
- Comprehensive test strategy with incremental complexity building
- Realistic understanding of algorithmic limitations (no sub-O(n) solution exists)
- Good analysis of alternative approaches and their trade-offs
- Professional constraint clarification before implementation

Areas for Refinement:
- Python type hint syntax for union types (| operator)
- Continue building confidence in complexity analysis accuracy

Status: ğŸ”„ NEEDS SPACED REPETITION - Follow review schedule to achieve mastery
Note: Shows strong pattern recognition across diverse algorithm types
