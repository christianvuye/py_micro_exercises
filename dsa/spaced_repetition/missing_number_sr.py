Missing Number - Spaced Repetition

Write a function, missing_number, that takes in a list of integers as an argument.
The list contains n distinct numbers taken from the range 0 to n (inclusive).
The function should return the missing number from this range.

There is exactly one missing number in the range.

Sample Test Cases:
missing_number([3, 0, 1]) â†’ 2
missing_number([0, 1, 2, 4, 5]) â†’ 3

After completing, analyze time and space complexity.

=== EXERCISE #14 SUMMARY - MISSING NUMBER (SPACED REPETITION) ===

Pattern Mastery: ðŸŸ¢ STRONG ALGORITHM WITH QUICK BUG FIX
- Correct set-based approach for O(1) membership testing optimization
- Proper understanding of range-based iteration for missing number detection
- **Initial Bug**: Used max(nums) instead of len(nums) for range calculation
- **Quick Fix**: Immediately corrected logic after explanation of edge case failure

Interview Readiness: ðŸŸ¢ GOOD ALGORITHMIC THINKING
- Professional edge case clarification questions (positive vs non-negative integers)
- Understanding of problem constraints (distinct numbers, exactly one missing)
- Clean implementation with proper type hints and documentation
- Solid complexity analysis with optimization insights

Spaced Repetition Performance: ðŸ“ˆ STRONG IMPROVEMENT FROM PREVIOUS EXERCISES
- No Python syntax errors or comprehension issues
- Logic error was conceptual, not implementation-based
- Quick debugging and correction when bug was identified
- Demonstrated understanding of alternative approaches (sum formula, XOR)

Next Review Schedule:
- Tomorrow (Sept 1): 1st review - focus on range calculation logic
- Sept 3: 2nd review (+2 days) - should be routine by then
- Sept 6: 3rd review (+3 days)
- Sept 9: Final review before interview

Time Complexity: O(n) - iterate through range 0 to n, set lookup O(1) per check
Space Complexity: O(n) - set storage for all distinct input elements
Pattern Type: Missing element detection using set membership optimization
Core Skills: Set optimization, range iteration, edge case analysis

Key Strengths Demonstrated:
- Excellent set-based optimization understanding for membership testing
- Strong complexity analysis including space/time trade-offs
- Professional clarifying questions about input constraints
- Quick identification and correction of logical error
- Knowledge of alternative algorithmic approaches (sum, XOR methods)

Areas for Minor Improvement:
- **Initial Logic**: Range calculation should be based on expected size, not max value
- **Edge Case Thinking**: Consider when missing number is the maximum possible value
- **Algorithm Selection**: Could mention O(1) space alternatives for completeness

Status: ðŸŸ¢ SOLID PROGRESS - Much cleaner execution than previous exercises
Note: Shows significant improvement in implementation accuracy and algorithmic reasoning
