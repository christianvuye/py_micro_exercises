Character Frequency - Spaced Repetition

Write a function, character_frequency, that takes in a string as an argument.
The function should return a dictionary where keys are characters and values
are their frequency counts in the string.

Example:
character_frequency("hello") â†’ {'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 2, 'o': 1}
character_frequency("aabbcc") â†’ {'a': 2, 'b': 2, 'c': 2}
character_frequency("") â†’ {}

Write your own test cases and implement the solution.
After completing, analyze time and space complexity.

=== EXERCISE #3 SUMMARY - CHARACTER FREQUENCY (SPACED REPETITION) ===

Pattern Mastery: ðŸŸ¢ STRONG PROGRESS
- Dictionary accumulation pattern implemented cleanly
- Manual approach shows solid understanding of fundamentals
- Correct if-else logic for key existence checking

Interview Readiness: ðŸŸ¢ EXCELLENT ANALYTICAL SKILLS
- Outstanding requirements clarification questions (spaces, punctuation)
- Caught instructor error in space complexity explanation
- Strong critical thinking about what data structures actually store
- Knowledge of library alternatives (defaultdict, Counter) with trade-offs

Spaced Repetition Performance: ðŸ“ˆ EXCELLENT FIRST ATTEMPT
- Clean manual implementation without library dependencies
- Comprehensive test coverage with assert statements
- Good edge case thinking (empty string, repeated characters)
- Professional approach to ambiguous requirements

Next Review Schedule:
- Tomorrow (Aug 30): 1st review
- Sept 1: 2nd review (+2 days)
- Sept 4: 3rd review (+3 days)
- Sept 8: 4th review (+4 days)
- Interview Sept 10: Should be automatic by then

Time Complexity: O(n) where n = string length
Space Complexity: O(k) where k = unique characters, worst case O(n)
Pattern Type: Dictionary accumulation with frequency counting
Core Skills: Hash table operations, key existence checking, requirements clarification

Key Strengths Demonstrated:
- Excellent requirements clarification: "should I count spaces and punctuation?"
- Caught instructor's imprecise space complexity explanation
- Correct understanding that frequency storage is additional space beyond input
- Knowledge of defaultdict(int) and Counter alternatives
- Clean manual implementation demonstrating fundamental understanding

Status: ðŸ”„ NEEDS SPACED REPETITION - Follow review schedule to achieve mastery
Note: Shows exceptional analytical thinking and professional interview behavior
