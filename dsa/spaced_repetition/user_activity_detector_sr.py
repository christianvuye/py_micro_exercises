User Activity Detector - Duplicate User Detection

You have a list of user activity logs. Each log entry contains a user ID and a timestamp.
Find all users who appear more than once in the logs.

The logs can contain up to 100,000 entries.
Return a list of user IDs that appear more than once in the logs.

=== EXERCISE #27 SUMMARY - USER ACTIVITY DETECTOR (SPACED REPETITION) ===

Pattern Mastery: ðŸŸ¢ CLEAN EXECUTION
- Classic frequency counting with manual dictionary approach
- Correct filter pattern: count all, then select by threshold
- Proper tuple indexing to extract user_id from log[0]

Interview Readiness: ðŸŸ¢ ADVANCED COMPLEXITY REASONING
- Sophisticated analysis of n vs u relationship (total logs vs unique users)
- Understanding of data reduction impact on space usage
- Professional requirements clarification about data structure format
- Recognition of O(n) as optimal bound for counting problems

Spaced Repetition Performance: ðŸ“ˆ STRONG FIRST ATTEMPT
- No syntax struggles with dictionary operations or list comprehension
- Clean implementation without unnecessary complexity
- Proper edge case handling for empty inputs

Next Review Schedule:
- Sept 2: 1st review (+2 days)
- Sept 5: 2nd review (+3 days)
- Sept 9: 3rd review (+4 days)
- Interview Sept 10: Pattern should be automatic

Time Complexity: O(n) - must examine every log entry, optimal for counting
Space Complexity: O(u) typically, O(n) worst case where u = unique users
Pattern Type: Frequency counting with threshold filtering
Core Skills: Dictionary operations, tuple indexing, list comprehension filtering

Key Strengths Demonstrated:
- Advanced complexity analysis considering real-world data distributions
- Understanding of optimal bounds for counting problems
- Clean manual dictionary implementation showing fundamental grasp
- Professional documentation with clear parameter descriptions

Status: ðŸ”„ NEEDS SPACED REPETITION - Follow review schedule  
Note: Shows sophisticated understanding of algorithmic analysis beyond basic Big O
