Exclusive Items - Symmetric Difference

Write a function `exclusive_items` that takes in two lists as arguments.
The function should return a new list containing elements that are in either list but not both lists.
You may assume that each input list does not contain duplicate elements.

def exclusive_items(list_a: list, list_b: list) -> list:

    Returns a list of items that are present in either list_a or list_b, but not in both.

        list_b (list): The second list of items.

    Returns:
        list: A list containing items that are exclusive to either list_a or list_b.

    Example:
