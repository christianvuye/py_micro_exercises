Find Complement - First Number with Complement

Write a function `find_complement` that takes in a list of numbers and a target sum as arguments.
The function should return the first number in the list that has a complement (another number in the list)
such that the two numbers sum to the target value. If no such number exists, return None.

    Finds and returns a number from the input list whose complement (target - number) also exists in the list.

    Args:
        nums (list[int | float]): List of integers or floats to search.
        target (int | float): The target value to find complements for.

    Returns:
        int | float | None: The first number in the list whose complement exists in the list, or None if no such pair is found.

    Example:
        >>> find_complement([1, 2, 3, 4], 5)

=== EXERCISE #23 SUMMARY - FIND COMPLEMENT (SPACED REPETITION) ===

Pattern Mastery: ðŸŸ¢ EXCELLENT PROBLEM SOLVING
- Strong Counter-based approach for frequency tracking
- Perfect self-complement edge case handling (frequency > 1 check)
- Clean iteration through original list order for "first occurrence" requirement
- Professional debugging approach when hidden tests failed
- Shows mastery of frequency-based complement problems

Interview Readiness: ðŸŸ¢ STRONG DEBUGGING SKILLS
- Comprehensive clarifying questions about constraints and edge cases
- Professional response to test failures: requested specific failure details
- Iterative improvement: set approach â†’ Counter approach with edge case fix
- Clean code structure with proper early returns
- Excellent pattern recognition for self-complement cases

Spaced Repetition Performance: ðŸ“ˆ SOLID COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS
- Accurate time complexity: O(n) with Counter creation + main loop
- Correct space complexity: O(n) for unique element storage
- Minor typo correction: len() operations are O(1), not O(n) âœ…
