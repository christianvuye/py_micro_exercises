Value Positions - Index Collection with Filtering

Write a function `value_positions` that takes in a list of numbers and a target value as arguments.
The function should return a list of all indices where the target value appears in the input list.
If the target value does not appear in the list, return an empty list.

=== EXERCISE #24 SUMMARY - VALUE POSITIONS (SPACED REPETITION) ===

Pattern Mastery: ðŸŸ¢ CLEAN IMPLEMENTATION
- Optimal linear search approach with index collection
- Clean enumeration pattern for simultaneous value/index access
- Proper empty list edge case handling
- Simple, readable solution without unnecessary complexity
- Shows mastery of basic index collection patterns

Interview Readiness: ðŸŸ¢ EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE
- Fast completion: ~8 minutes vs 10 minute target
- Comprehensive clarifying questions about data types and constraints
- Professional documentation with clear type hints
- Clean code structure with logical flow
- All edge cases handled correctly

Spaced Repetition Performance: ðŸ“ˆ EXCELLENT COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS
- Accurate time complexity: O(n) - must scan entire list always
- Correct space complexity: O(n) worst case when all elements match
- Strong understanding of amortized append operations
- Good analysis of best/worst case scenarios for space usage
- Clear reasoning about unavoidable linear scan requirement

Next Review Schedule:
- Sept 1: 1st review (tomorrow)
- Sept 3: 2nd review (+2 days)
- Sept 6: 3rd review (+3 days)
- Sept 9: 4th review (+3 days) [Final prep before interview]

Time Complexity: O(n) - must examine every element
Space Complexity: O(n) worst case when all elements match target
Pattern Type: Linear search with index collection and filtering
Core Skills: Enumeration, list accumulation, linear search

Key Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clean, straightforward implementation approach
- Accurate complexity analysis with best/worst case understanding
- Professional edge case identification and handling
- Fast problem-solving with minimal complexity
- Strong understanding of result list growth patterns

Status: ðŸ”„ NEEDS SPACED REPETITION - Follow review schedule to achieve mastery
Note: Shows excellent velocity and clean implementation skills
