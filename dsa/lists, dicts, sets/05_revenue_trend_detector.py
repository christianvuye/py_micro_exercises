Revenue Trend Detector

You're analyzing sales data to identify products with concerning revenue
trends. Given daily revenue data, find all products that have both:
1. Total revenue above a minimum threshold across all days
2. A declining trend (more than half of consecutive day-pairs show decline)

Each record is a tuple: (product_id, date, daily_revenue)
Note: Data may not be sorted by date.

Requirements:
- Return a list of product_ids that meet both criteria
- A "declining trend" means > 50% of consecutive day-pairs show decline
- Handle edge cases (single day data, identical revenues, etc.)

Example:
sales = [
    ("P1", "2024-01-01", 100), ("P1", "2024-01-02", 90),
    ("P1", "2024-01-03", 80), ("P2", "2024-01-01", 200),
    ("P2", "2024-01-02", 220), ("P2", "2024-01-03", 190),
    ("P3", "2024-01-01", 50)
]
min_total_revenue = 250

Expected result: ["P1"]
- P1: total=270 (>250), trend: 90<100, 80<90 → 2/2 declines (100%) ✓
- P2: total=610 (>250), trend: 220>200, 190<220 → 1/2 declines (50%) ✗
- P3: total=50 (<250), only 1 day → doesn't qualify ✗

=== INTERVIEWER COMMUNICATION SUMMARY ===

Initial Request: 
"Analyze sales data to identify products with declining revenue trends that meet 
minimum revenue thresholds. Handle unsorted date data and calculate consecutive 
day-pair trend percentages."

Developer Clarifications Asked:
- "Are we comparing all possible pairs (O(n²)) or just consecutive pairs (O(n))?"
- "Should I break this into multiple functions instead of one complex function?"
- "What data structure should I use to store both total revenue and daily data?"
- "How do I handle the unsorted dates requirement?"

Interviewer Responses:
- Confirmed consecutive pairs only (not all pairs)
- Encouraged breaking into helper functions for cleanliness
- Suggested dictionary with nested structure for aggregation + daily data
- Confirmed need to sort daily data chronologically per product

Final Technical Decisions:
- Dictionary structure: {product: {"total_revenue": int, "daily_data": [(date, revenue)]}}
- Helper function for trend analysis: `filter_declining_products(daily_data)`
- Two-pass algorithm: collect data, then analyze per product
- Time complexity: O(n + k log m) where n=sales, k=products, m=avg days per product
- Space complexity: O(n) for storing sales data in grouped format

Key Learning Moments & Meta-Analysis:
- **Exercise Design Critique**: Developer correctly identified this exercise as overly complex
  and not serving core learning goals of DSA fundamentals
- **DSA Philosophy Insight**: "Isn't the goal of DSA to reduce complexity, not increase it?
  Smart solutions should simplify problems" - excellent algorithmic thinking
- **Pattern Recognition**: Immediately spotted this combined multiple concepts (aggregation + 
  sorting + trend analysis + consecutive comparison) rather than isolating one new concept
- **Engineering Judgment**: Questioned brittleness and realism, showing mature software
  engineering perspective about complexity for complexity's sake

Critical Learning Outcomes:
- **Space Complexity Heuristics Mastered**: "Single-level storage per input = O(n), 
  two-level nested storage = O(n²), focus on growth rate not number of data structures"
- **Consecutive vs All Pairs**: Learned consecutive pairs = O(n), all pairs = O(n²)
- **Function Decomposition**: Successfully used helper function to reduce cyclomatic complexity
- **Algorithm Elegance Principle**: Best algorithms feel "almost too simple" once found

Exercise Evaluation (Developer's Assessment):
- "Feels like tracking nested data/indexes across multiple loops for complexity's sake"
- "Very unrealistic and beyond the goal of practicing basic data structures"
- "Should be massively simplified, separated into parts, made less brittle"
- "Previous exercises (1-3) were better - focused on one core pattern each"

Professional Skills Demonstrated:
- ✅ Questioned exercise design and learning objectives
- ✅ Advocated for simpler, cleaner solutions
- ✅ Understood when complexity doesn't serve the goal
- ✅ Maintained focus on fundamental patterns despite artificial complexity
- ✅ Successfully implemented working solution despite reservations
- ✅ Showed excellent meta-cognitive awareness of learning process

Meta-Lesson for Future Exercises:
Good DSA practice should teach elegant simplification, not construct artificial complexity.
Developer's algorithmic intuition and engineering judgment are developing excellently.
